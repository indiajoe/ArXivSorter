# ArXiv Sorter

Your personal intelligent ArXiv assistant who will sort papers in arXiv based on your likes and dislikes of other papers.
ArXiv Sorter learns your like and dislikes based on simple Machine learning algorithms.

### Purpose: 
	 + Keywords or author based searches are not efficient enough to help a Grad student discover papers in their fields of interest.
	 + It is too boring to scan through an unsorted list of papers published each day in arXiv every morning.
	 + It is more fun to code than read boring abstracts ;-P

## Under construction!  Not yet a reliable assistant, show some love.
